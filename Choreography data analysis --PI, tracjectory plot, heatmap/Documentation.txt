In the code_for_trajectory_heatmap_trackingtime_PI
we change the input 
edge, ns, both_ns, both_edge, both-->you want to eliminate the first 120s or edge or not-->
if yes, input the correct number, both will be 'y' or []
tt_plot,heatmap,centered_plot,trajectory,PI_plot-->whether you want to plot these or not-->'y' or []

this code will also save the PI mean and PI for each larvae in the folder 'PI_data',
you need to change the name_of_folder and outdir based on your folder 

PI:v_x/speed for each larvae
heatmap: count how many times each larvae cross this specific (x,y) region 

*all data eliminate trajectories with tracking time less than 10s
